# stpm34-eagle-library

This is a Eagle library containing ST's STPM34 chip (ASSP for metering applications with up to four independent 24-bit 2nd order sigma-delta ADCs, 4 MHz OSF and 2 embedded PGLNA): http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/data-converters/metering-ics/stpm34.html

## STPM33

If you use STPM33 you can use this library too simply by not connecting pins 15 & 16

## STPM32

STPM32 comes in smaller package (QFN24 instead of QFN32) which this library doesn't contain. If you need to use STPM32 in eagle then plese extend this library and pull request.
